4. Each color chosen will list every color combination (text color + background color) and display the contrast ratio and rate them according to WCAG 2.0.

The stars indicate the WCAG standard:

Here is how the number of stars are calculated:
if contrast ratio >= 7, output 5 stars // AAA for normal text

if contrast ratio >= 4.5, output 4 stars // AA for normal text or AAA for large text

if contrast ratio >= 3, output 3 stars // AA for large text or for UI components

if contrast ratio >= 2, output 2 stars // Below standard, but somewhat discernible

It will also display a check mark or x next to the contrast ratio indicating that it has met the minimum recommendation for readability according to WCAG: 4.5 contrast score

5. If you want to move your chosen color up or down the pallette use the arrows next to the chosen colors

6. If the current theme (dark mode) interferes with your palette try using the toggle dark/light mode button at the top right of the screen:
